let bodyTemperature2 = HKQuantity(unit: degFUnit, doubleValue: 95)


print(bodyTemperature1.description)

print(bodyTemperature2.description)


if bodyTemperature1.is(compatibleWith: degFUnit) {
   
   print("Temperature #1 in Fahrenheit degrees:     \(bodyTemperature1.doubleValue(for: degFUnit))")

}
```
